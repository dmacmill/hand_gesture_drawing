# hand_gesture_drawing
Written by Maximilian Markmanrud and Daniel MacMillan

The goal of this project was to implement hand gesture recognition without the need for depth data using two different methods - with a CNN and without a CNN.


## Running Gesture Recognizer with CNN
```
cd src
python app.py
```
make sure you are running python 2.7

## Running Gesture Recognizer without CNN
```
cd old_attempts
python display.py
```
make sure you are running python 2.7
