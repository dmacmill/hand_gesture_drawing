\section{Goal}
The field of computer vision has changed dramatically with recent innovations in machine learning algorithms, with innovations in convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning being extraordinarily influential in modern innovations. In this project our goal was to look at different ways to have the user control an app that tracks the location of the finger tips and see which methods of control are more intuitive and responsive than others. In this project we also looked at ways to implement a simple finger painting application - with and without a CNN - and then analyse the benefits and drawbacks of the two methods.
